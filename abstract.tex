\section*{Abstract}

This note presents a description of the GlueX DIRC simulation and reconstruction software. The geometrical algorithm, based on the one developed for the BABAR DIRC, can be used as the baseline recontruction method for the start of the DIRC operation in 2018. The time imaging reconstruction has potential for better performance but requires additional development work. It performs better than the geometrical method for the existing timing resolution per photon of 1 ns. The KDE-based method is planned to be used for the tracks where the PID is not clear after the baseline reconstruction is run (on average, the resolution for the KDE-based method is 30{\%} better than for the geometrical reconstruction).
